		<h2> Shushma's Story </h2>
		<hr class="two-panel-divider-three featurette-divider">
		<p>
			Sushma Verma (born on Feb 4, 2000) holds the Limca Book of World records for being India’s youngest graduate by finishing high school at the age of 7. She’s currently 14 years old and pursuing masters in microbiology from B.R. Ambedkar University in Lucknow, India (her hometown).
			Sushma interestingly broke her elder brother’s record of finishing high school at age 9. Her father is a daily wage labourer (with a daily wage of up to 200 rupees (less than $3.50) and her mother is a housewife. To make Sushma’s education possible, her father sold his only pieces of land — 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) in a village in Uttar Pradesh — for the price of 25,000 rupees (about $400) to cover some of her school fees. Interestingly, Sushma’s mother never went to school, though her father has finished upto middle school (class VIII).
			After finishing class 12, Sushma took the Combined Pre-Medical Test (CPMT) for admission to the MBBS course in India, but her result was withheld because the authorities found her to be underage. For the same reason, she is currently in the field of microbiology and finished masters at age 15. 
			FundKnowledge is helping her come to US for pursuing PhD.
